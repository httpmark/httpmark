# WebAppTest

A modern version of WebpageTest.

For detailed information [check out the Wiki!](https://github.com/jameshopkins/webapptest/wiki)

## Quick start guide

### Running locally

First you will need to [download and install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

Once Docker has installed, open a terminal window inside the `webapptest` directory and run `$ npm run dev`.

When the script has finished running you should see a message in the terminal telling you where the app is running, (e.g. `localhost:3000`). The application is setup with hot module reloading on both the client and server, so any local changes should reflect in the browser immediately.

_Note: Setup can take some time as it needs to install all project dependencies (queue elevator music...)_
