# HTTPMark

> httpmark is an end-to-end tool for measuring and analysing the performance of web applications within a variety of test contexts. These can include geographical region, CPU throttling, device emulation, etc.

## Features

###Â Get Test Results In Seconds

Each test agent is represented by a Docker container, so they're immutable and incredibly quick to spawn.

### Real-time Feedback

The test agent executes a test through a Chromium instance that's linked back to the application UI through a long-lived connection, meaning results are returned streamed back to your browser.

### One-Click Deploy

The entire infrastructure for the private instance is immutable and described through [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), meaning that you can deploy your instance in seconds.
